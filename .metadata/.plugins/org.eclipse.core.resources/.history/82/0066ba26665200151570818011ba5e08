I'm a first year graduate student in Computer Science. 
I made this android app a few months back that tracks user's location and notifies people-friends/family.

So it's like you can create a trip, say Stony Brook to NYC, and add bunch of your friends in the 
list of recipients. So the app will notify your friends when:

-you leave SBU
-you reach NYC
